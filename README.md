I used these guides for doing the basic conversion:

&nbsp;&nbsp;https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/tips-tricks/converting-html-sites-to-wordpress-sites

&nbsp;&nbsp;https://websitesetup.org/html-to-wordpress/

I used this documentation to modify it further to fit our website more specifically(one example is the JS file):

&nbsp;&nbsp;https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/including-css-javascript/



The current setup to view the new theme and new home page is to "Live Preview" the new theme, then click on the "Hello" on the old homepage, which will now link you to "/new-home". This "New Home Page" is a page you can find in the pages list.

To upload any changes to the theme, zip up the theme directory, then upload through the "theme" section.
